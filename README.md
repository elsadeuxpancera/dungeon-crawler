# Dungeon Crawler Game

When I was a kid, I loved the old text-based Infocom games, like *Zork* and *Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy*. You can still find emulators of them online. I always wondered how they were built.

In this project, you’ll build your own **text-based dungeon crawler** using object-oriented programming in Java. Your game will simulate a player exploring a dungeon made up of rooms that contain monsters and items.

## Provided Classes

You are given the following classes:

- `Game`
- `Player`
- `Map`
- `Room`
- `Item`
- `Monster`

Each class contains **TODOs** that you must complete.

---

## Class Responsibilities

| Class | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `Game` | User input + game loop |
| `Player` | Tracks state (health, inventory, position) |
| `Map` | Owns grid of `Room`s |
| `Room` | Contains `Item`s + `Monster`s |
| `Item` / `Monster` | Data + description |

# Project Progression (Checkpoints)

You must complete each checkpoint before moving on.

---

## Checkpoint 1: Items, Monsters, and Rooms

### Your Tasks
- Complete `Monster`
  - Randomly select a monster type
  - Implement `toString()`
- Complete `Item`
  - Randomly select an item type
  - Implement `toString()`
- Complete `Room`
  - Generate random numbers of items and monsters
  - Create and populate `ArrayList`s
  - Implement `toString()` to display contents

### You are done when:
- You can run:

    `Room room = new Room();`
    `System.out.println(room);`

- The output shows a list of items and monsters

---

## Checkpoint 2: Map Creation

### Your Tasks
- Initialize a 2D array of `Room` objects in `Map`
- Use nested loops to populate every location
- Implement `getRoom(row, column)`

### You are done when:
- You can run:

    `Map map = new Map(5, 6);`
    `System.out.println(map.getRoom(0, 0));`
    `System.out.println(map.getRoom(2, 3));`

- No `null` values appear

---

## Checkpoint 3: Player Setup

### Your Tasks
- Initialize player fields:
  - Name
  - Health
  - `(x, y)` position
  - Inventory (`ArrayList<Item>`)
- Implement:
  - `moveTo(int x, int y)`
  - `getRoom(Map map)`
  - `look(Map map)`

### You are done when:
- You can run:

    `Player p = new Player(100, "Hero", 0, 0);`
    Map map = new Map(5, 6);`

    System.out.println(p.look(map));`
    `p.moveTo(1, 2);`
    `System.out.println(p.look(map));`

---

## Checkpoint 4: LOOK Command

### Your Tasks
- In `Game`, implement:
  - `LOOK`
  - `SEARCH`
- These should print the current room description

### You are done when:
- Typing `LOOK` shows room contents

---

## ✅ Checkpoint 5: Player Movement

### Your Tasks
- Implement movement commands:
  - `MOVE UP`
  - `MOVE DOWN`
  - `MOVE LEFT`
  - `MOVE RIGHT`
- Validate movement **before moving**
- Prevent movement outside the map

### Rules
- Invalid moves should display an error message
- Valid moves should:
  - Update player position
  - Print coordinates
  - Print room contents

### You are done when:
- Movement works in all directions
- The player cannot leave the map
- No crashes occur at the edges

---

## Checkpoint 6: Inventory (UWHS Only)

### Your Tasks
- Implement:
  - `addItemToInventory(Item item)`
  - `removeItemFromInventory(Item item)`
  - `hasItem(String itemName)`
- Add commands:
  - `TAKE <item>`
  - `DROP <item>`

### You are done when:
- Items can move between the room and the inventory
- `hasItem()` works correctly

---

## Checkpoint 7: Combat System (UWHS Only)

### Your Tasks
- Add:
  - Player health system
  - Monster health system
  - Item damage values
  - Equip system
- Implement `FIGHT`

### You are done when:
- The player can fight a monster
- Health updates correctly
- Monsters can be removed when defeated

---

# Extension Ideas

If you finish early, consider adding:

- Boss monsters
- Win condition
- Map visualization (grid printout)
- Advanced command parsing (example: `TAKE SWORD`)
- Random events

#  Rubric

| Criteria | Points | Points (UWHS) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Submitted properly to GitHub and compiles | 50 | 50 |
| Checkpoint 1 | 20 | 10 |
| Checkpoint 2 | 20 | 10 |
| Checkpoint 3 | 10 | 10 |
| Checkpoint 4 | Included above | Included above |
| Checkpoint 5 | Included above | Included above |
| Checkpoint 6 | N/A | 10 |
| Checkpoint 7 | N/A | 10 |
| **TOTAL** | **100** | **100** |

# Important Tips

- Build and test one checkpoint at a time  
- Do not move forward if something is broken  
- Use `.equals()` for string comparison, not `==`  
- Initialize all `ArrayList`s before using them  
- Be consistent with row/column vs x/y  

---

# Final Advice

This project is about **building step by step**. Early programmers who created games like *Zork* did not write everything at once—they built systems incrementally and tested constantly.

Do the same:

- Get one part working  
- Then build on top of it
